example of using openframeworks and apple's accelerate framework

![image](accelerateExample.png)

this example generates 100,000 random shapes with 256 points each,  using sin and cos (with random angle speeds, etc) and finds the one closest to a straight line, a shape with x increaing linearly and y constant.  It uses apple's accelerate framework to do the math, grouping all the data into giant vectors for subtraction, distance and mean calculation. 

I will add some benchmarks shortly, but it seems to be a pretty substantial speed up (as far as I can tell)â€¦   posting this here in case it's helpful for anyone looking for accelerate examples. 

Also, I found [this tutorial](http://www.ffnn.nl/pages/articles/apple-mac-os-x/vectorizing-with-vdsp-and-veclib.php) pretty helpful.
